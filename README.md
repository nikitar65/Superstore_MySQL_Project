<h2>About the Company</h2>

• The company largely sells various items of furniture along with phones in the United States of America.

• It has divided the regions of operations into four: Central, East, West and South.

• It caters to three different segments: Consumers, Corporate and Home Office.

<h2>Observations</h2>

From a cursory analysis of the data, following observations were drawn about the Furniture category:

• While tables is the second highest selling product in the category, it a loss making subcategory with 8% profit margins. Higher sales of tables may cause other profit making products to sell less as the composition of inventory will be different.

• Furnishings is the most profitable, however, it is the least selling subcategory in all regions except South.

• Central region has incurred losses at an overall level.

<h2>Next Steps</h3>

**Tables**

• Renegotiations may be done with the existing vendors, if applicable, who are manufacturing the table.
<br>• The materials used in the tables may be changed to what is in demand.</br>

**Furnishings**

• Discontinuing or scaling down certain sub categories will enable a better reallocation of the budget towards furnishing.
<br>• This could help in increasing marketing activities such as giving discounts to attract customers.<br>

**Stores in the Central region**

• The feasibility of keeping the store(s) operational in the Central region should be assessed, which could be done by analysing the data from previous years.
<br>• The stores in the Central region should also be evaluated based on the product mix.</br>

**Other ways to increase revenue**

• Value added services such as furniture repairs and furnishings could be offered.
