![Superstore_MySQL_Project_2901](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124327898/216510795-3be05401-ecbe-45b5-b089-0971ac7030b9.jpg)

From a cursory analysis of the data, following observations were drawn about the Furniture category:

• While tables is the second highest selling product in the category, it a loss making subcategory with 8% profit margins. Higher sales of tables may cause other profit making products to sell less as the composition of inventory will be different.

• Furnishings is the most profitable, however, it is the least selling subcategory in all regions except South.

• Central region has incurred losses at an overall level.

**The following steps should be taken to increase revenue and minimize losses**

**Tables**

• Renegotiations may be done with the existing vendors, if applicable, who are manufacturing the table.
• The materials used in the tables may be changed to what is in demand.

**Furnishings**

• Discontinuing or scaling down certain sub categories will enable a better reallocation of the budget towards furnishing.
• This could help in increasing marketing activities such as giving discounts to attract customers.

**Stores in the Central region**

• The feasibility of keeping the store(s) operational in the Central region should be assessed, which could be done by analysing the data from previous years.
• The stores in the Central region should also be evaluated based on the product mix.

**Other ways to increase revenue**

• Value added services such as furniture repairs and furnishings could be offered.

**Appendix**

**Approach**

• Acquired the dataset from a publicly available source and imported it into a SQL database.

• Used MS Excel to clean the data and ensure that it is in a format that can be easily analyzed. 

• Used SQL to extract relevant information from the data, such as the sales, profit margins among others.

• Analyzed the datasets using advanced SQL to extract insights.

• Used Powerpoint to present the information to the concerned stakeholders.

**SQL Functions Used**

• Joins
• Case Statements
• Window Functions
